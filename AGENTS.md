# AGENTS.md

Ansible control node that deploys the **self-hosted NetBird server** (combined
`Management + Signal + Relay + STUN` container) with the dashboard and a built-in
Traefik reverse proxy onto a public Debian-family VPS. Idempotent and
version-controlled.

This project deploys the **server**; the NetBird **client agent** lives in the
sibling `docker-stack-iac` project. Tenant resources (users, groups, setup keys,
policies, networks, DNS) are managed against the running server's REST API via the
`community.ansible_netbird` collection; desired state lives in the per-host vars
and is rendered by `playbooks/tenant.yml` (config-as-code). **Peers are enrolled
devices, not codifiable state** — only their settings are managed; desired
enrollment is expressed through groups/setup keys/policies.

Managed hosts live in `inventory/hosts.yml` (local-only/gitignored; committed
template `inventory/hosts.yml.example`, topology only) and are never hardcoded
into docs, roles, or templates; the project-owned baseline for every managed host
(engine range) is committed in `inventory/group_vars/all/main.yml`. The
`management` inventory group is the single source of truth: it runs the
self-hosted server stack (`roles/management`) and is the play target for every
playbook (`site.yml`, `tenant.yml`, `backup.yml`, `restore.yml`, `bootstrap.yml`,
`host_keys.yml`, `ssh_agent_load.yml`). `make host-bootstrap` targets one host
(`HOST=<name>`, default the single management node). Entry playbooks:
`playbooks/site.yml` (server deploy) and `playbooks/tenant.yml` (tenant
config-as-code).

## Integration contract (the mesh as a service)

This project owns the **mesh**: the management server, the tenant (groups,
networks, policies, DNS, setup keys) and the netbird agents of the hosts it
owns. Other projects consume the mesh **only through the running service's public
interface** — the management REST API and the embedded DNS — never by reading
this project's vars/vault. Rules:

- **Agent ownership = host ownership.** A host's netbird agent is owned by the
  project that owns the host (e.g. the central docker host's agent belongs to
  `docker-stack-iac`). A host is never split across projects; the mesh inputs it
  needs (`management URL` + a setup key) are credentials the operator supplies to
  that project's own vault.
- **Contract (the documented interface):** the tenant guarantees these groups,
  referenced by consumers by name:
  - `home-router` — routed-network gateways;
  - `observability` — the central monitoring stack host (scrapes `endpoint` and
    `home-router`; their peers push logs to it);
  - `endpoint` — observed-only clients with no routes (e.g. this server host).
  Setup keys assign them: `docker_host_setup_key` → [home-router, observability];
  `endpoint_setup_key` → [endpoint]; `admin_setup_key` → [admin].
- **Discovery inputs** for a consumer (held in the consumer's own vault): the
  management URL and a service-user PAT. Per-peer `ip` / `dns_label` / `groups`
  come straight from `GET /api/peers`; nothing needs to be exported from here.

## Secrets and local-only files

- `inventory/hosts.yml` — gitignored; holds each managed host's real name and
  connection address/port (`ansible_host` / `ansible_port`). The committed
  template `inventory/hosts.yml.example` carries the `CHANGE_ME_HOST_IP`
  placeholder, and the site preflight rejects it until it is replaced.
- `inventory/host_vars/<hostname>/vault.yml` — **gitignored, never committed**
  (even encrypted). The single per-host encrypted vault, holding **only
  credentials**: the SSH identity passwords (`vault_host_iac_password` /
  `vault_host_admin_password` / `vault_host_root_password`), the optional
  first-owner password (`vault_owner_password`), values the control node generates
  when the user leaves them empty and passes TO the host
  (`vault_datastore_encryption_key`, `vault_session_cookie_encryption_key`,
  `vault_relay_auth_secret`, `vault_owner_password`, `vault_host_iac_password`,
  `vault_host_admin_password` (only when `create_admin_account` is set)), and the
  secrets the host returns (see below). Every non-secret value — the ACME
  contact email (`acme_email`), the first owner (the `netbird_users` entry with
  `role: owner`), hostnames, URLs, paths, toggles and tenant state — lives in the
  `main.yml` next to it, with its real value; nothing non-secret is mirrored
  through the vault.
  Of the crypto keys, only `vault_datastore_encryption_key` is user-critical: it is
  **not** in the backup archive and a restore must reuse the same value, or the
  encrypted user data is unrecoverable. `vault_session_cookie_encryption_key` and
  `vault_relay_auth_secret` are auto-generated internals — leave them unedited
  (regenerating them only drops sessions / re-auths the relay; they must match
  across instances only for HA or an external relay, both out of scope here).
  Each identity may set a password (here) and/or a private key path (non-secret,
  in `main.yml`); SSH prefers the key, then the password. An optional public key
  file (`host_*_ssh_pubkey_file`, also in `main.yml`) is
  authorized for that account by `make host-bootstrap` when set. Because these are
  inputs, set them here to bring your own value (e.g. a datastore key on restore).
  Schema reference: `inventory/host_vars/example/vault.yml.example`.
  Secrets the host returns are stored here too (written by the role, never by
  hand): `vault_service_admin_access_token` (the `admin` service-user PAT,
  minted by NetBird during the first-owner bootstrap; expires, recreate it from
  the Dashboard) and `vault_<setup-key-name>` (one per new setup key; the API
  returns the secret only at creation, non-alphanumerics in the name replaced by
  `_`). Writes fill only missing values; existing non-empty values are preserved
  (never rotated).
- **After a host is reinstalled/reimaged** the host-returned values
  (`vault_service_admin_access_token` and the `vault_<setup-key-name>` keys)
  no longer exist on the new server. Because a present non-empty value is
  preserved, a stale token would survive and every tenant run would fail with
  "token rejected". Delete those keys from `vault.yml` (e.g. via `make vault-edit`)
  before the first deploy on the rebuilt host. With an owner entry in
  `netbird_users`, the first-owner bootstrap writes a fresh
  `vault_service_admin_access_token`; the tenant play writes the new
  `vault_<setup-key-name>` values. Without an owner entry, set the PAT manually
  (see the Dashboard flow above).
- Vault password file: `~/.config/projects/netbird-management-iac/ansible_vault_password`
  (pointed to by `ansible.cfg`; auto-generated by `make vault-init`). An
  encrypted vault cannot be read without it.
- `backup/<host>/<stamp>/` — **gitignored**. Contains `netbird_data.tgz` (user
  PII, hashed credentials). It does **not** contain the encryption key; keep
  `vault.yml` (the datastore key) safe separately. Never commit
  backups; keep a copy off-host.
- `vault_service_admin_access_token` — the `admin` service-user PAT used by
  `playbooks/tenant.yml`. Provisioned automatically on a fresh deploy; otherwise
  set it manually in `vault.yml`. **It expires (max 365 days) and cannot be
  renewed** — when a tenant run reports it rejected, recreate one for the `admin`
  service user in the Dashboard (Team → Service Users) and update the vault. The
  project fails fast with these instructions instead of rotating proactively.

## Commands

- Control-node prerequisites: ansible-core within the supported range (pinned in
  `.tool-versions`, currently 2.19.x; asserted by the `playbooks/site.yml`
  preflight), Python 3, `openssl`, and the Galaxy collections from
  `requirements.yml`.
- `make install` — install the pinned toolchain (mise/asdf), the Galaxy
  collections, `sshpass`, and Keychain 3. sshpass is ensured by the internal
  `ensure-sshpass` target: passwordless `apt-get` when available, otherwise
  rootless into `~/.local/bin/sshpass`; a failure is fatal (install it manually
  and re-run). Only the `make host-bootstrap` password probe needs sshpass;
  steady-state Ansible password auth uses ssh_askpass, so the server/tenant/backup
  targets do not need it. Keychain is ensured by the internal `ensure-keychain`
  target: it downloads the pinned single-file zipapp (version + SHA256 in
  `keychain.pin`, Renovate-tracked) into `~/.cache/netbird-management-iac/` and installs it
  to `~/.local/bin/keychain`. It is a fallback ssh-agent used only when a
  configured private key has permissions OpenSSH rejects (e.g. WSL `/mnt/c`):
  every SSH-consuming target runs through the shared, project-agnostic
  `scripts/run-with-ssh-agent.sh` (driven by the `SSH_AGENT_*` environment
  variables), the internal `agent-fallback` prepares the agent (probe-gated by
  the internal `agent-needed`; `agent-ensure` is the unconditional variant) and
  loads the keys via `playbooks/ssh_agent_load.yml`, and the runner retries once
  on a refused-key failure. The `keychain-*` / `ensure-keychain` /
  `verify-keychain-pin` / `agent-*` targets are internal and are never exposed as
  public `make` commands.
- `make vault-init` — create the vault password file if missing (runs before
  every deploy/lint target).
- `make vault-view [HOST=<name>]` — print the decrypted `vault.yml`; **every host
  by default**, or a single host with HOST.
- `make vault-edit [HOST=<name>]` — edit one host's `vault.yml` (HOST, or the
  single host when the inventory holds exactly one; the target list is printed
  when it is omitted and the inventory has several); a plaintext `vault.yml` is
  encrypted first, the keys are re-sorted alphabetically on save, and a save is
  refused when the vault changed while the editor was open (the edited text is
  kept for a merge).
- `make host-init [HOST=<name>] [HOST_IP=<addr>] [HOST_PORT=<port>]` — scaffold
  `inventory/hosts.yml` and `inventory/host_vars/<name>/` **comment-free** from the
  committed `example/` template, encrypt the scaffolded `vault.yml`, and add the
  host to the inventory group (`GROUP`, default `management`) with its
  connection address/port (`HOST_IP` defaults to the `CHANGE_ME_HOST_IP`
  placeholder the site preflight rejects until replaced; `HOST_PORT` is omitted
  when unset). HOST defaults to `netbird-1`. Idempotent: existing files are kept,
  and an already-present host is left unchanged unless `FORCE=1`, which
  overwrites a conflicting address/port. Edit the vault with
  `make vault-edit HOST=<name>`.
- `make host-bootstrap` — host init only: ensures Docker Engine + Compose v2
  (installing Docker CE when missing), sets APT/Docker mirrors for
  region-restricted hosts, and probes [iac, admin, root] to
  create the `iac` automation account plus the `admin` account when `create_admin_account`
  is set. Run standalone
  to init a host without deploying; `make deploy` runs it automatically first
  (so a fresh/rebuilt host gets its service account before `site.yml` connects).
  The mirror parts are no-ops unless their vars are set.
- The internal `make lint` (`--syntax-check` + `ansible-lint` +
  `scripts/audit_example_knobs.py`, the host-key and repository-privacy checks,
  and the `gitleaks` tree scan) is run by CI and hidden from `make help`
  (developers can still invoke it). The audit keeps `host_vars/example/main.yml`
  a complete, value-accurate mirror of every operator knob. The privacy check
  rejects tracked local-only trees, credential files and real addresses or host
  names; CI additionally scans the full history with `gitleaks`.
- `make dry-run` / `make deploy` — dry-run / deploy. `deploy` is the one-shot
  entry point: it runs `bootstrap.yml` (host init), then the server playbook,
  then applies the tenant state (`tenant.yml -e tenant_commit=true`), then
  converges the host monitoring (`monitoring.yml`, which also joins the overlay
  through the agent); add
  `TAGS=...` to skip the tenant apply and run only the server. Tags:
  `netbird`, `netbird_preflight`, `netbird_config`, `netbird_deploy`,
  `netbird_owner`. Two opt-in host-security roles live in the same playbook and
  have their own tags: `firewall` (default-deny inbound base firewall, see
  `docs/components/firewall.md`) and `sshd` (key-only SSH,
  `docs/components/sshd-hardening.md`) — `make deploy TAGS=firewall` / `TAGS=sshd`
  runs only one of them. Both are off until enabled per host
  (`firewall_enabled` / `sshd_hardening_enabled`).
- `make plan` — tenant config-as-code, **read-only diff** (safe default).
- `make apply` — apply the tenant desired state. Requires
  `vault_service_admin_access_token`. Use it to change tenants without
  redeploying the server. Both plan and apply first run the local value gate
  (`scripts/validate_tenant_config.py`) over the effective desired state and fail
  with a per-field report before rendering or applying it when a value is
  unusable. Strict
  mode (also remove unmanaged resources) is off by
  default — absent, empty, or `false` `tenant_strict` means non-strict; only
  `tenant_strict: true` in `inventory/host_vars/<host>/main.yml` (or
  `-e tenant_strict=true`) enables it. The apply (and `deploy`'s tenant step) is
  retried on a transient network-level failure via `scripts/retry-transient.sh`,
  because the pinned collection does not retry its API calls; a configuration or
  token error still fails fast.
- `make backup` / `make restore FROM=backup/<host>/<stamp>` —
  stop-container snapshot of the `netbird_data` volume, and the paired restore.
  Keep `vault.yml` separately; a restore needs the same datastore key.
- `make monitoring` — optional host monitoring + host security (Debian-family):
  installs `prometheus-node-exporter`, `crowdsec` (journald-based detection) and
  the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` (nftables enforcement), and joins the host to
  the overlay through the shared `agent` role. Opt-in per host with
  `monitoring_enabled: true` in
  `host_vars/<host>/main.yml`; default off. node_exporter binds the overlay
  address only (no local or public listener; a boot drop-in waits for the overlay
  so the bind survives a reboot). The agent resolves its setup key
  (`netbird_peer_setup_key`) from the host's own vault
  (the route-less `endpoint` key by default, which grants no exit/LAN routes)
  and the exporters bind the overlay
  address; with `alloy_enabled: true`
  + `loki_push_url` an Alloy container ships journald SSH events to a central Loki
  over the overlay (an overlay IP, or preferably the central peer's NetBird name
  `<peer>.netbird.selfhosted`, resolved by the container through the agent). With
  `prometheus_remote_write_url` set it also scrapes the local exporters every
  `alloy_scrape_interval` (default `15s`, 1s-30s) and remote-writes the samples to
  the central Prometheus, tagged `source="agent"`; the cadence has to stay inside
  the dashboards' 60s `rate()` window.
- `make print [HOST=<name>]` — resolved host vars incl. decrypted vault; HOST
  is auto-detected when the inventory has a single host.

## Change workflow

- **Every change lands through a pull request.** Work on a `<type>/<slug>` branch
  (`fix/vault-path`, `feat/host-timezone`, `ci/pr-title-gate`), open a PR against
  `main`, wait for the required checks, and squash-merge it.
- **The PR title becomes the commit on `main`.** Squash sets it verbatim, so it
  must be a Conventional Commit: `<type>(<scope>)?: <description>` with
  `feat | fix | chore | docs | refactor | test | ci | build | perf`. The `pr-title`
  check rejects anything else, because release-please cuts the release from that
  title and an invalid one silently drops out of the changelog.
- **Squash is the only merge method.** Merge commits and rebase are disabled, so
  the PR title is exactly the commit that lands and the `pr-title` check is what
  release-please reads. Merged branches are deleted automatically.
- **Required checks** on the `Protect main` ruleset: `lint` and `pr-title`, with
  the branch up to date with `main`. There are no required approvals, so a solo
  change merges as soon as CI is green. The ruleset also forbids deleting `main`
  and force-pushing to it, and it carries **no bypass actor**: neither the owner
  nor an agent working with the owner's credentials can push to `main` directly.
- **One concern per PR.** Unrelated fixes, dependency bumps and docs for a
  different concern belong in their own PR, so each squash commit stands alone and
  can be reverted on its own.
- **Break-glass is a ruleset change, not a bypass.** When the checks themselves are
  unusable (a GitHub Actions outage, or a required check that cannot pass), the
  owner temporarily disables the `Protect main` ruleset, lands the fix, and
  re-enables it. That is an explicit, visible action; there is no standing bypass.
- **Release PRs take the same path.** release-please opens one on
  `release-please--branches--main`, and the `release-please` workflow enables
  auto-merge for a non-major version; a major release stays open for a manual
  merge.

## Important gotchas

- The public domain's A record must point at the host and **TCP 80/443 + UDP 3478**
  must be open **before** deploy, or Let's Encrypt (TLS-ALPN-01) and STUN will not
  work. The full contract is in `docs/components/networking.md`. The optional host
  firewall (`firewall_enabled`) enforces exactly that contract rather than
  replacing it — it defaults to the same three ports and re-verifies them from the
  control node after applying.
- SSH hardening (`sshd_hardening_enabled`, `roles/sshd`) is **opt-in and
  self-protecting**: it closes password login, so it refuses to run unless a
  keyed login survives it — the `iac` account's key, or root's key with
  `sshd_permit_root_login: prohibit-password` — and it reverts itself when a
  verification fails. Enable it only after `make host-bootstrap` has authorized
  the key. The human `admin` account keeps
  its password for the console only; give it a public key
  (`host_admin_ssh_pubkey_file`) to keep SSH access.
- The deploy **requires the non-root service account**: `playbooks/site.yml`
  asserts `ssh_user != root` (override with `allow_root_login=true`).
  `make host-bootstrap` probes [iac, admin, root] and uses the
  first that works; when it is not `iac` it creates `iac`. Every explicitly set
  `host_root_ssh_pubkey_file` / `host_iac_ssh_pubkey_file` /
  `host_admin_ssh_pubkey_file` is
  authorized for the matching account (unset ignored, never generated); for
  `iac` a missing key falls back to a password from
  `vault_host_iac_password` (generated when empty), while key mode omits the
  password. The optional human `admin` account is created only when
  `create_admin_account` is set and always gets a password (generated into
  `vault_host_admin_password` when empty) plus any configured key. Passwords are
  hashed with a per-account random salt and applied with `update_password: on_create`,
  so re-runs are idempotent and a host-side password rotation is preserved.
  `iac` gets passwordless sudo; `admin` gets password sudo (`ALL=(ALL) ALL`).
- The vault file must never stay plaintext: `write_vault` always encrypts, and a
  plaintext `vault.yml` (e.g. restored from backup) is re-encrypted on the next
  write by the vault helpers.
- Config files are rendered to `{{ stack_dir }}` and applied with
  `community.docker.docker_compose_v2`. **Rendering is the source of truth**; never
  edit the files on the target host (see `docs/components/roles.md`).
- `vault_service_admin_access_token` expires (max 365 days) and cannot be
  renewed — recreate it from the Dashboard when a tenant run reports it rejected
  (see Secrets above).

## Ansible conventions: probe & bootstrap host targeting

Shared by the `*-iac` repos; keep this chain statically resolvable so
`--syntax-check` stays clean:

- **Control-node-only plays** (preflight, the SSH probe, `host_keys`,
  `ssh_agent_load`) use `hosts: localhost` + `connection: local` — never
  `hosts: all` + `connection: local`.
- **The action play that follows a probe** targets a host/group that resolves
  from the static inventory. Never target a dynamic-only group: it forces either
  an empty-group declaration in the inventory or a `--syntax-check`
  "Could not match supplied host pattern" warning.
- **Single-host bootstrap** targets the probed host **by name**, with a safe
  default — `hosts: "{{ bootstrap_host | default(groups['<group>'] | default([]) | first | default('', true)) }}"` —
  and `make <target> HOST=<name>` passes `-e bootstrap_host=<name>`.
- **Multi-host bootstrap** targets the real inventory group. `add_host` only
  injects the probed identity/vars onto a host already present in the inventory;
  it never creates a play target.
- **The probe must verify escalation, not just login.** An identity other than
  `root` is usable only when it can actually become root: proven with
  `sudo -n true` for the NOPASSWD `iac` account, while a password-sudo identity
  (`admin`) is proven with `sudo -S` before it is chosen. A
  half-provisioned account (login OK, sudoers not yet written) must never be
  chosen, or the bootstrap can no longer repair that host.

## Testing and verification

Two layers, and only one of them is executable:

- **Automated** — `make lint` (syntax check, ansible-lint, the knob schema, the
  example audit, the host-key and repository-privacy checks, `gitleaks`) and
  `make test` (the helper suite under `tests/`). Both run in CI on every change.
- **Manual** — the cases that need a disposable host, a throwaway domain and
  destructive steps. They are a checklist in `docs/RUNBOOK.md` §11 and are re-run
  when a role, the bootstrap or the backup path changes. They are not automated:
  `tests/` covers the helpers, not a live SSH session.

### Environment and safety boundaries

- **Live hosts are read-only.** Inspect them with `make print`, `make vault-view`,
  `docker inspect`, `systemctl status` and external probes. No deploy, bootstrap,
  backup, restore, firewall or SSH-hardening run targets a live host.
- **Every state-changing or destructive case runs on a disposable Debian-family
  host** (systemd, Docker Engine with Compose v2, nftables, sshd) that can be
  rebuilt from scratch.
- **Isolate the test environment**: its own inventory (never the real
  `inventory/hosts.yml`), its own vault password file, its own domain and DNS
  record. Reusing a live domain breaks ACME validation and the STUN contract.
- **Ask before creating resources** — hosts, domains, DNS records — and before
  anything that costs money or touches a system outside the test host.
- **Order of work**: read-only checks first, then state-changing cases, then
  destructive ones; snapshot or back up before every destructive step.
- **Never print, paste or commit secrets.** Redact evidence before quoting it; a
  secret in a log or a report is itself a defect to record.

### Execution rules

- Write the expected result before running a case; never backfill it.
- Cases are independently runnable; declare prerequisites where order matters.
- A defect gets a reproducing case before anything else happens.
- Separate product defects from environment failures, and state the evidence for
  that call.
- Skip only with a recorded reason; never count an unexecuted case as a pass.
- No change to the product to make a case pass; no drive-by fixes.

### Recording and defects

- Keep raw logs, `-vvv` output, `docker inspect`, `systemctl status` and probe
  responses under `/tmp/opencode/test-run-<UTC stamp>/artifacts/<case>/`; never
  store a decrypted vault, and redact before quoting.
- Severity: `blocker` (data loss, outage, security), `major` (feature unusable, or
  docs contradict behaviour), `minor`, `nit`. Each entry carries a minimal
  reproduction, expected vs actual, impact, evidence path and a suggested fix;
  merge entries that share a root cause.

### Definition of done

- `make lint` and `make test` green;
- the manual checklist passes on the disposable host, and a second run at the
  same desired state reports `changed=0` outside the documented non-idempotent
  steps;
- every destructive path fails safely with an actionable message;
- no unexplained high-severity security finding;
- every conclusion points at evidence, and every unexecuted check names the
  reason and what would unblock it.

## Scope

- **In scope**: self-hosted server + dashboard + built-in Traefik, embedded Dex
  IdP (local users), optional first-owner bootstrap (which also provisions the
  `admin` service-user PAT for tenant automation), tenant/ACL config-as-code
  (`playbooks/tenant.yml` + per-host vars), optional host monitoring/host
  security (`playbooks/monitoring.yml`), optional host base firewall and key-only
  SSH hardening (`roles/firewall` / `roles/sshd`, both opt-in per host), and
  backup/restore.
- **Not codifiable** (inherent): **peers** are enrolled devices (only settings are
  managed; devices re-enroll with setup keys), local-user **passwords** (returned
  once at creation), setup-key/PAT **secret values** (returned once), IdP client
  secrets (store in vault), and **audit/events** (read-only).
- **Out of scope (here)**: the client agent (owned by `docker-stack-iac`) and the
  NetBird Proxy / Agent Network quickstart components, plus external
  reverse-proxy modes beyond `trusted_peers`.
